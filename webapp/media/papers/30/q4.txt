4. (a) State the Bezier formula. What is the Bezier matrix for a cubic spline?
[7]
(b) A quadratic spline is specified by the equation
x(u) = UB−1b
where U is the row matrix of powers of u, B−1b are the constraints for
the curve. If a curve passing through the two points p0 and p1 is to be
first-order continuous at p0, derive an expression for x(u) in terms of the
endpoints and dx(u)/du. [12]
(c) How would you control a piecewise spline of the form given in (b)? Why
might interpolating splines be preferred to approximating splines in draw-
ing programs? [6]
