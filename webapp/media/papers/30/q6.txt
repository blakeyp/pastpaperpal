6. (a) The F-shaped object shown below is to be doubled in size and rotated
about point p by 60o. Give the homogeneous transformations which are
performed on the vertices of the object and the final concatenated matrix.
F = { f0 , f1 , ...  , f9 }
p

(b) A View Volume is specified by the bottom-left hand corner of the Near
plane, at (L, B) and the top-right hand corner of the Far clipping plane, at
(R, T). If the clipping planes are at distances N and F from the viewpoint,
derive the Orthographic Projection Matrix. [12]
(c) An Oblique Projection is required that displays all lines parallel to the
z-axis drawn at an angle A = 30o to the horizontal on the view plane, as
shown below.
0
A = 30
Work out a transformation matrix that can be concatenated with your
answer to (b), to perform this type of projection. [7]
