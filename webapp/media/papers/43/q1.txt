1. Primitive Data Types and Control Statements
(a) Java has four primitive integer variable data types. The smallest of which is a byte (8
bits). Give the binary and decimal representation of both the largest and the smallest
value a byte can hold. [2]
(b) Floating point numbers in Java are represented using IEEE-754 notation. Given an
8-bit floating point number, where the exponent is 3 bits and the fraction is 4 bits, and
the number is calculated using the formula:
(sign)1.(fraction)× 2(exponent−3)
calculate the value of the number 01101100. [5]
(c) The following code will not compile. Explain why this is the case and give two valid
ways to resolve the error. [3]
public static void main(String args[]) {
double a = 8374;
int b = a;
System.out.println(b);
}
(d) Program control in Java can be managed using if and switch statements. Rewrite
the following code in the most concise form possible using an if-else statement.
[5]
switch (a) {
case 4: System.out.println("Option 4");
case 2: System.out.println("Option 2");
break;
case 1: System.out.println("Option 1");
default: System.out.println("Default");
}
(e) Given x = 0, determine the validity and the truth value of the following statements,
as well as the value of x following evaluation.
i. (x == 0) || (x++ < 2)
ii. (x > 2) & (x++ < 2)
iii. (x != 0) & ((100 / x) != 2)
