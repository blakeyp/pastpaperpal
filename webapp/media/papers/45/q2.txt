2. (a) Explain the four types of reasoning that can be done using probabilistic inference. [4]
(b) Suppose that there are two independent sensors, traffic camera (TC) and flow sensor
(FS), for detecting congestion on road R. TC is 92% effective at identifying conges-
tion when it is present, but has a 28% false positive rate. FS has a true positive rate
of 71% and a 19% false positive rate. Suppose that the probability of congestion
on R is 0.7. Which sensor returning positive is a better indicator of congestion, as-
suming only a single sensor is used? Justify your answer mathematically and give
P (congestion|TC) and P (congestion|FS). [6]
(c) Using inference by enumeration and the Bayesian network below, compute the prob-
ability of Congestion Detected given Traffic App and Radio Alert are true. [12]

(d) Suppose that you are tasked with constructing a Bayesian Network for a traffic man-
agement system, and are given an ordered set of nodes 〈X1, X2, . . . , Xn〉. Describe
how you would use Pearl’s Bayesian Network construction algorithm to create the
network. [3]
