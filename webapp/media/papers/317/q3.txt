3. (a) How is symmetry used to scan convert circles? [3]
(b) Show with a diagram the setup of the Midpoint method for curves. [4]
(c) Show that the increment in the decision parameter for Bresenham’s mid-
point circle drawing method is
Pk+1 = Pk + 2(xk + 1) + (y
2 2
k+1 − yk)− (yk+1 − yk) + 1
and hence state the appropriate increments of Pk for the two cases: Pk ≤ 0
and Pk > 0. [10]
(d) Derive a value for P0. [4]
(e) Give two simple ways of filling the circle. [4]
