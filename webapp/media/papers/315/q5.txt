5. (a) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of compiling to a virtual machine
(such as JVM) as opposed to straightforward translation to assembly code.

(b) Consider the following program and function expressed as 3-address code:
x := 11
y := 13
t1 := x + y
z := t1 * 2
a := 17
b := 19
t2 := a * b
z := z * t2
Perform the register allocation procedure to assign one of the available 3 registers
(R0, R1, and R2) for each variable, and show the resulting code. Include code
for spilling if needed. Explain any algorithms and criteria that are used.
