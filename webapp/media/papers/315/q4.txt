4. (a) Explain and illustrate two different methods to translate Boolean expressions
into intermediate code in 3-address form, and compare them in terms of effi-
ciency and speed.
[11]
(b) Explain what is an activation record. Describe the steps that need to be per-
formed and code that needs to be generated when translating function decla-
rations and function calls. Illustrate with the following function written in a
language with static binding, paying special attention to non-local variables:
function main () {
int a, b ;
read (a) ; read (b);
print (f (a)) }
function f (x) {
int y = a + x/2 ;
if y < b then return (y)
else return (f (y)) }
