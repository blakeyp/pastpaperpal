3. (a) Construct an LR(0) state machine for the following grammar:
Z -> E $
E -> T T -> i
E -> E + T T -> ( E )
[14]
(b) Most programming languages support several forms of parentheses (curly, round,
and square brackets, for example). Considering that many common program-

sider both top-down and bottom-up parsers.
