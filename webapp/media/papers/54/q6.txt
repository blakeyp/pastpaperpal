6. (a) Using pseudo-code, describe the sorting algorithm mergesort. Illustrate your 
description by showing the intermediate lists produced while applying mergesort to 
the following values: 
    3  8  1  0  5  2  4  9      [7 marks] 
 (b) What is the worst-case running time for mergesort? Justify your answer. [4 marks] 
(c) Using pseudo-code, describe the sorting algorithm quicksort. Illustrate your 
description by showing the intermediate lists produced while applying quicksort to 
the same values as in (a).       [7 marks] 
(d) What is the worst-case running time for quicksort? Justify your answer. [4 marks] 
(e) How might you improve the running time for quicksort?   [2 marks]
