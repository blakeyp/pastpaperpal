1. (a) State formally what is meant by: 
  f(n) is θ (g(n))         [3 marks] 
 (b) Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false, justifying your 
answers: 
i. 100n3 is O(n3) 
ii. n log(n)  is Ω(n) 
iii. n2 is θ (n2 + n)      [6 marks] 
(c) The following algorithm computes the determinant of a matrix of size 3. How many 
basic operations will be required to complete the calculation? State clearly any 
assumptions you make. 
Algorithm determinant(X) 
// Input array X of size 3 
// Output an integer d which is the determinant of X 
d ←  0 
for i ←  0 to 2 do 
d ←   d + X[i,0] * (X[i+1 % 2, 1] * X[i+2 % 2, 2] – 
 X[i+2 % 2, 1] * X[i+1 % 2, 2] ) 
  return d
