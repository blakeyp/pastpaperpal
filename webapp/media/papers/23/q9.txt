9. (a) Give the definition of the following concepts: [6]
i. The span of a set of vectors V
ii. A subspace S of Rn
iii. A basis of a subspace S
(b) Prove that the following sets each form a basis for R4: [4]
i. V = {(1, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1, 1)}
ii. W = {(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1,−1,−1), (1,−1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1,−1)}
(c) An orthogonal basis is one where every distinct pair of vectors in the basis is perpen- [7]
dicular. For example, the standard basis is orthogonal. Let M be the square matrix
formed with the vectors of a basis as columns. Prove that MTM is diagonal if the
corresponding basis is orthogonal. Is either of V or W an orthogonal basis?
