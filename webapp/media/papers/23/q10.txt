10. (a) If x is real show that the maximum value of [8]
x2 − x+ 1
y =
x2 + x+ 1
is 3, and the minimum is 13 . Draw the graph of y as a function of x.
(b) i. Find the general solution to the 2nd order homogeneous linear recurrence [9]
2un+1 + 3un − 2un−1 = 0.
ii. Give a necessary and sufficient condition on u0 and u1 such that the sequence
defined by the recurrence converges.
iii. Find the general solution to the 2nd order linear recurrence:
2vn+1 + 3vn − 2vn−1 = n− 3.
iv. If u0 = u1 = 0, give a formula for un.
