5. Exceptions and Generics
(a) Exceptions can be used in the Java programming language to allow programmers to
detect and gracefully handle errors.
i. Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions. Define two
exception classes, a checked exception called ParseException and an unchecked
exception called PrintException. A single constructor method for each will
be sufficient. [5]
ii. You are using the following code in your application:
public class UtilFunctions {
public static int stringToInt(String input)
throws ParseException {
...
}
...
}
Describe, with an example how you would use the stringToInt function in
your code. [3]
(b) Describe the main motivating factors behind using Generics in the Java programming
language. [4]
(c) Rewrite the following data structure using Java generics (You may ignore any poten-
tial errors that result from exceeding the size of the array). [4]
public class Array {
private Object[] values;
private int counter;
public Array(int size) {
values = new Object[size];
counter = 0;
}
public void add(Object o) {
values[counter++] = o;
}
public Object get(int i) {
return values[i];
}
}
