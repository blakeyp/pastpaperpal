1. Primitive Data Types and Control Statements
(a) List Javaâ€™s eight primitive types, along with the range of each of the integer types. [3]
(b) Java can convert variables between various types.
i. Explain, with examples, the difference between an implicit typecast and an ex-
plicit typecast. [4]
ii. Given the following code, what will the output be and why? [3]
public static void main(String args[]) {
short a = 3450;
byte b = (byte) a;
System.out.println(b);
}
(c) Program control in Java can be managed using if and switch statements. Rewrite
the following code in the most concise form possible using a switch statement. [5]
Scanner sinput = new Scanner(System.in);
int c = sinput.nextInt();
if (c == -1) System.out.println("Exiting application");
else if (c == 0) System.out.println(
"Please enter a number between 1 and 3");
else if (c == 1) System.out.println("Entering mode 1");
else if (c == 2) System.out.println("Entering mode 2");
else if (c == 3) System.out.println("Entering mode 3");
else System.out.println(
"Please enter a number between 1 and 3");
(d) Given the following code,
int a = 1, b = 2;
if (a == 1)
if (b == 3) System.out.println("A is 1 and B is 3");
else
System.out.println("A is not 1");
i. What will the output be, and why? [2]
ii. Rewrite the code using a single if statement, and fix any semantic errors. [3]
