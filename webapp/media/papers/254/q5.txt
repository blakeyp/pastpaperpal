5. (a) Explain the memory hierarchy with the aid of a diagram. Comment on the motivation
for the hierarchy and its role in computer system design. [10]
(b) The diagram below shows a 4M×1 memory integrated circuit (IC). Explain how a
CS1320 
collection of these ICs could be organised in the design of a 16M×8 memory. Justify
the organisation and state how many ICs would be required. [7]
(c) Computer systems commonly use cFaigucre h5.1e s to improve performance.
i. Outline the role of caches in the memory hierarchy. [3]
