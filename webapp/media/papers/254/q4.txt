i. Explain the operation of interrupt-driven I/O. [5]
ii. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of memory mapped I/O and interrupt-
driven I/O. [5]
(b) Microprocessors function on the basis of a set of interacting components.
i. Give a detailed account of the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Your answer should
give details of the specific microprocessor components involved. [8]
