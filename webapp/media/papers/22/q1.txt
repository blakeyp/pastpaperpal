1. (a) A process p is executing on a CPU. Explain all the possible state changes that 
 can happen to p and the cause(s) behind each of them.    [6]  
(b) What is context switching with respect to scheduling?   [2] 
(c) Explain whether context switching happens when  
(i) a process blocks while waiting to access a resource.   [2] 
(ii) a process spinlocks while waiting for a resource.   [2]  
(d) A variant of the producer-consumer problem is as follows: A producer process 
reads or writes to a database while a consumer process only reads from the 
database. Two or more consumers may access shared data while a producer 
needs to have exclusive access to the shared data. There are multiple 
producers and consumers in the system. All processes share the following data 
structure:  
semaphore update; 
    All consumer processes share the following data structures:  
semaphore mutex; 
int num-of-consumers; 
The semaphore update acts as a mutual-exclusion semaphore for producers, 
whereas the semaphore mutex is used to ensure mutual exclusion when the 
variable num-of-consumers is being updated. The variable num-of-consumers 
keeps track of the number of consumers currently reading the shared data. The 
initial values of the different data structures are: (1) update is set to 1,           
(2) mutex is set to 1 and (3) num-of-consumers is set to 0.  
(i) Write pseudocode to illustrate the structure of the producer process [3] 
 (ii) Write pseudocode to illustrate the structure of the consumer process, 
making clear any assumption(s) you make.    [7] 
 (iii) Explain a possible weakness of your solution.   [3]
