6. (a) (i) Explain the term protocol, and describe the purpose and operation of a 
   ‘layered protocol’ structure.      [4] 
  (ii) A system has an n-layer protocol hierarchy. Applications generate  
   messages of length M bytes. At each of the layers, an h-byte header 
   is added. What fraction of the network bandwidth is filled with  
   headers?        [2] 
 (b) (i) Describe the TCP/IP Reference Model and briefly mention the purpose 
of each layer. [5] 
  (ii) Explain the term jitter, and state one application for which it is  
   important to minimise jitter.      [3] 
(iii) Describe how TCP segment flow is controlled using a sliding window.
         [4] 
(iv) In TCP, why is efficiency reduced if an application is producing too 
little data at a time for TCP transmission, or an application is 
consuming too little of the data received. Suggest solutions that can be 
employed to reduce these inefficiencies.     [4] 
(v) The round-trip time between two hosts has been found to be 64ms. If 
the bit rate of the link between the hosts is 480 kbps, what minimum 
TCP window size (in bytes) is required such that, when data is 
continually being sent, the buffers will not overflow?  [3]
