5. (a) (i) Describe the operation of the MAC protocol used in classic Ethernet, 
and explain the purpose and operation of the binary exponential back-
off algorithm.  [6] 
  (ii) Why is it not possible to use the MAC protocol used in Ethernet for a 
wireless local area network?  [2] 
 (b) A 100 Mbps CSMA/CD local area network (not Ethernet) has equally spaced 
nodes and a total length of 2km.The signal propagation speed in the cable is    
2 x 108 m/s. There are no repeaters. 
  (i) If two stations start to transmit at exactly the same time, what will be 
the mean time for them to detect a collision?  [3] 
  (ii) Given the above parameters, what minimum frame length (in bits) is 
required for correct operation of the CSMA/CD protocol?  [3] 
 (c) (i) Describe the basic architecture of a Bluetooth personal area network 
and briefly explain how Bluetooth-enabled devices communicate with 
each other.                                                                                           [4] 
  (ii) Why does a Bluetooth frame contain redundant information and how is 
the redundancy utilised? [2] 
  (iii) Bluetooth uses frequency hopping spread spectrum with a hop rate of 
1600 hops/s. What is the length of a time slot in bits, given that the 
bandwidth is 1 MHz and information is coded at the rate of 1 bit/Hz? 
 [2] 
  (iv) In each slot of the Bluetooth system described in (c)(iii) above, 259 Î¼s 
is needed for hopping and control mechanisms. Packets can be of 1, 3 
or 5 slots in length. How long does the frame last in each type of 
packet? [3]
