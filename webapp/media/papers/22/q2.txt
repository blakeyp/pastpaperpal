2. Four processes, labelled P1, P2, P3, P4, exist in a computer system. They entered the 
system at times t = 0, 0, 1, 1 respectively. They have, respectively, the following 
actual CPU bursts: ⟨2, 1, 1⟩, ⟨1, 3⟩, ⟨1, 1, 3⟩, ⟨2, 3, 1⟩. They are to be scheduled using 
the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm.  
(a) Develop the schedule generated when a preemptive EDF is used on the 
process set using the actual CPU bursts.     [5]  
(b) Calculate the average waiting time for the schedule in (a) above.  [5]  
(c) Since we cannot schedule using actual CPU bursts, it is proposed to develop a 
schedule based on predicted CPU bursts. CPU bursts are to be predicted using 
exponential averaging, using only the most recent history information. 
Develop the schedule generated when a non-preemptive EDF is used on the 
process set using the predicted CPU bursts. You can assume that the first 
predicted burst always matches the actual burst. You can also assume that, in 
the case of a tie, the process with the smallest id has precedence.           [10]  
(d) Calculate the average waiting time for the schedule developed in (d) above.
