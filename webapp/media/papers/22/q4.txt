4. (a) (i) Explain the term bandwidth, and differentiate between baseband and 
 bandpass signals. Use diagrams to illustrate your answer. [4] 
  (ii) What maximum sampling period (in μs) is necessary for all 
 information to be captured in a digitised 4 kHz telephone channel? [2] 
 (b) (i) With the aid of diagrams, explain the terms (1) Frequency Division 
  Multiplexing (FDM) and (2) Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). [4] 
 (ii) Explain the term Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL). [4] 
(iii) How are FDM and TDM utilised in the GSM mobile phone system?
          [3] 
(c) (i) Give two advantages and one disadvantage of using a packet-switching 
 network over a circuit-switching network.    [3] 
 (ii) Three packet-switching networks each contain n nodes. The first  
  network has a star topology with a central switch node, the second is a 
  bi-directional ring, and the third is fully interconnected, with a wire 
  from each node to every other node. What are the best-, average-, and 
  worst-case transmission paths in hops?    [3] 
(d) Chip sequences used in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are pair-wise 
 orthogonal. In other words, the normalised inner product (ST) of any two 
 distinct sequences, S and T, is zero.

 What can you conclude about the number of corresponding chips that must 
 match in any two distinct chip sequences?     [2]
