3. (a) Explain the difference between synthesized and inherited attributes. [8]
(b) Consider the following grammar for arithmetic expressions:
S -> E T -> T "*" F F -> id
E -> E "+" T T -> F F -> num
E -> T F -> "(" E ")"
i. Show two specific ways in which error recovery can be added into an LR parser
for this language. Illustrate with examples. [8]
ii. Any arithmetic expression can be associated with its postfix form, which places
the operator after the representation of both operands. For example, the postfix
of (5+4)*(3+2) is 5 4 + 3 2 + * . Design attribute rules for the above grammar
that produce the postfix representation of an expression. [9]
