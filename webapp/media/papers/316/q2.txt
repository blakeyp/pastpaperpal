2. (a) Consider the following grammar:
N -> L L -> B B -> "0"
N -> L "." L L -> L B B -> "1"
Explain why this is not an LL(1) grammar, and show a grammar for the same lan-
guage that is LL(1). [8]
(b) Consider adding multiple assignments of the form
var_1 = var_2 = ... var_n = Exp
to Java, to give all the variables the value of Exp.. Propose a syntax (productions) for
this feature such that it can be parsed with an LR(1) parser. Assume that appropriate
syntax for Exp already exists and all variables have already been declared. [9]
(c) LR parsing is based on the construction of what is known as a characteristic finite
state machine. Explain clearly how the states of the machine are constructed. [8]
