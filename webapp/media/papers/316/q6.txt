6. (a) Explain how data-flow information is generated from three-address code, and illus-
trate using any one kind of information such as reaching definitions, available expres-
sions, or live variables. [8]
(b) Many GOTO statements generated by simple compilers are unnecessary. Describe
two approaches for optimisation, either local or global, that can reduce the number of
unnecessary GOTOs. You may assume any representation for intermediate or object
code which will help explain the optimisations. [8]
(c) Consider the following three-address code snippet:
L1: j = 5
i = 0
L2: i = i + 1
t2 = 4 * j
t3 = a [t2]
t4 = 4 * i
a [t4] = t3
if i < m goto L2
return
Name and explain the loop optimisations that can be performed on this code and
show the resulting optimised code. [9]
