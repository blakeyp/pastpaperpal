1. (a) Textbooks typically describe a compiler as composed of distinct phases linked by
unidirectional arrows. Discuss reasons why real compilers are not usually structured
in this way. [7]
(b) Explain clearly the difference between pushdown automata and deterministic push-
down automata and the relevance of this distinction to parser construction. [7]
(c) Consider the grammar below:
S -> a S b | A B A | b A -> a b B A | a | eps
C -> A A c | d B -> A b A | b | C A
where S is the start symbol and eps is the empty string. Calculate the First and Follow
sets and the Nullable predicate for each of the nonterminals. [11]
