4. (a) The use of abstract machine code is a popular alternative to three-address code as a
class of intermediate representations, as exemplified by the current popularity of the
JVM. Compare and contrast these two approaches to intermediate code representa-
tion, and explain the benefits of each. [8]
(b) Explain how the Sethi-Ullman algorithm to minimize the number of registers used
works. Consider the statement a := b * c - 2 * d * (e + 1). Translate this
statement into generalized assembly code using the algorithm. Assume we have two
general-purpose registers available. [8]
(c) Typically booleans and integers are considered distinct types, but some languages
allow integers to be used as booleans, with 0 being equivalent to false and any non-
zero value being equivalent to true, while still allowing variables to be declared as
booleans. Provide syntex-directed definitions for type checking in such a language.
You may make assumptions about any precise restrictions and also assume any func-
tions needed to access symbol table. [9]
