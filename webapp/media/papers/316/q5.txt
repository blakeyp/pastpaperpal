5. (a) Describe the main steps that need to be performed when calling and returning from
procedures. Explain the difference between caller-saved and callee-saved registers.
Why do some architectures support both approaches? [8]
(b) Class definitions in object-oriented languages are represented via class descriptors.
Show the class descriptors generated by compiling the following program:
class A {int x = 2; a = new A
int f () {...} } b = new B
class B extends A {int y = 0; c = new C
int g () {...}}
class C extends B {int g () {...}}
Assume the language does not support multiple inheritance and uses dynamic method
lookup. [8]
(c) Many languages suppport the definition and use of data structures (such as a struct or
a record). Explain (informally but clearly) the type-checking aspects of introducing
these user-defined structured types. You need not consider variant records or circular
types. [9]
