2. Iterative Statements, Methods, Arrays and Recursion
(a) Write a method that, when called with a single integer argument, n, creates an array
of n integers with random values between 0 and 100 inclusive. [5]
(b) Describe what is meant by method overloading. Using your answer to (a), provide
an example of an overloaded method that can be used to set the maximum random
value. [3]
(c) Write a method that, when called with an array and an integer argument, s, performs
a linear search on the array reporting the array index of the first instance of s in the
list, or returning -1 if s is not found in the array. [6]
(d) Finally, write a recursive method that calculates the sum of the differences between
opposing pairs (i.e. the difference between A[0] and A[n-1], A[1] and A[n-2],
and so forth). For example, the array { 3, 6, 34, 65 } results in the calcula-
tion: (65− 3) + (34− 6) = 90.
You may assume the list will always be even in length. [6]
