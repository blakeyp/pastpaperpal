1. (a) Explain the four types of reasoning that can be done using probabilistic inference. [4]
(b) Your friend complains that their computer is slow. When a computer has a virus, this
causes it to be slow in 85% of cases. The prior probability of a computer being virus
infected is 1/10,000 and the prior probability of a slow computer is 1/500. What is
the probability that your friendâ€™s computer has a virus? [3]
(c) There are two independent tests for a disease. Test A is 97% effective at identify-
ing the disease when it is present, but has a 15% false positive rate and Test B is
80% effective with a 2% false positive rate. Suppose that 1 in 250 people have the
disease. Only one test can be used. Which test returning positive is a better indica-
tor of the disease? Justify your answer mathematically and give P (disease|A) and
P (disease|B). [6]
(d) Given the Bayesian network given below use inference by enumeration to compute
the probability of a memory fault given that a warning light and error message are
observed. [12]
