5. (a) What are the main components of a GPU-based framebuffer graphics
system? [4]
(b) Detail the 3D Viewing Pipeline, carefully explaining where texture-mapping,
blending and atmospheric effects, like fog, can be combined with vertex
operations. [4]
(c) Derive Bresenham’s decision parameter Pk+1 for the k + 1 step of a line,
given that Pk = 2∆y xk − 2∆x yk +K, where (xk, yk) is the currently set
pixel, the slope is ∆y and K is a constant term. What are the two values
∆x
that Pk+1 can take? [8]
(d) Outline how the Mid-point method works in efficiently scan converting
implicit curves. Derive the starting decision parameter value, P0, for a
drawing a circle centred at the origin, with radius r. [9]
