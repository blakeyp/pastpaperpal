7. (a) Work out the Bezier polynomials for a cubic spline. [5]
(b) Derive a Bezier matrix, B, for a cubic spline satisfying the blending for-
mula:
q(u) = UBb
making the definitions of U and b clear. [7]
(c) Derive the conditions under which 1st and 2nd order continuity can be
achieved between successive knots of the spline designed above. [7]
(d) Given the forward-differing approximation:
∆x(u) = x(u+ δ)− x(u),
find an expression for ∆x(u) if
x(u) = a 33x + a x
2
2 + a1x+ a0.
Explain why this result is helpful in reducing the calculations required to
draw splines. How many operations are required to calculated one step,
δ, forward when drawing a 2D cubic spline using forward-differencing? [6]
