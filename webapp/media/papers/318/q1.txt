1. (a) Explain how the human visual system’s capabilities are exploited by com-
puter graphics. [4]
(b) What are the standard components of a graphics system? Illustrate with
a diagram the main stages of a 3D viewing pipeline. [7]
(c) In OpenGL, what are matrix stacks? What do the following statements
each do and which matrix stack would you normally use them on?
i. gluOrtho2D (0, 1000, 0, 1000);
ii. glTranslatei (500, 500, 0);
glScalef (2.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f);
[7]
(d) Show how a rotation of θ about an arbitrary axis, (a, b, c)T , through the
origin, can be achieved by suitable rotations about the principal axes of
θx and θy and θz respectively. Calculate coefficients of rotation matri-
ces Rx(θx) and Ry(θy) and give a set of OpenGL statements which will
perform R(θ), if the angles are given in degrees. [7]
