1. (a) Explain why tasks are assumed to be independent in the Rate Monotonic 
Scheduling Algorithm (RMA).       [3] 
(b) Consider the following task set, where each task is represented as (execution 
time; period): T1 = (10; 50); T2 = (20; 75); T3 = (10; 100) 
(i) Calculate the utilization of the task set, assuming all tasks are released 
at t = 0.        [5] 
(ii) Derive the set of conditions to determine whether the task set is RMA-
schedulable.        [7] 
(c) Given the following task set: T1 = (10; 40); T2 = (20; 75); T3 = (35; 100); 
T4 = (15,150), determine whether there is any task that misses its deadline. 
Justify your answer and develop a schedule to illustrate this.            [10]
