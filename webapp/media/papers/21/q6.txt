6. (a) (i) Explain the operation of the binary exponential back-off algorithm as 
used in the CSMA/CD protocol employed by Ethernet. [4] 
(ii) The encoded bit stream shown below is detected on an Ethernet LAN. 
   Decode the information if: (1) Manchester Coding, and (2) Differential 
Manchester Coding, is used. [4] 
  (iii) A 100 Mbps CSMA/CD local area network (not Ethernet) has equally 
spaced nodes and a total length of 1.5 km. The signal propagation 
speed in the cable is 2 x 108 m/s. There are no repeaters. What is the 
minimum frame length (in bits) that is required for correct operation of 
the CSMA/CD protocol?  [3] 
 (b) Four stations, A, B, C and D exist within in an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. 
  A is within range of B and C, but not D. D is within range of B and C, but not 
  A.  
  (i) Explain what is meant by the hidden station problem  [2] 
  (ii) Station A wishes to send to C using the ‘Multiple Access with  
   Collision Avoidance for Wireless’ (MACAW) protocol that features 
   ‘virtual channel sensing’. With the aid of a timing diagram (for A, B, C 
   and D) explain the operation of the protocol.    [7] 
  (iii) Why may the successful throughput of a frame in this type of network 
   be increased by fragmenting the frame into smaller parts?  [2] 
  (iv) How is collision avoidance maintained if other stations set a network 
   allocation vector (NAV) only for transmission of the first of a number 
   of fragments and its corresponding ACK frame?   [3]
