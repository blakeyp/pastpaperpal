4. (a) Explain the purpose of the physical and data link layers in the OSI reference 
model. [4] 
 (b) (i) Consider a communication channel of bandwidth 2MHz and signal to 
noise ratio (S/N) of 251 (24dB). How many signal levels are required 
for 50% of the maximum possible data rate to be achieved?              [4] 
  (ii) Explain the difference between quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) 
and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). [4] 
  (iii) What is the maximum transmission rate in bits per second (bps) that a 
modem can achieve if the baud rate is 9600 and (1) QPSK, and         
(2) QAM-64, signalling methods are used?  [4] 
  (iv) A modem constellation diagram has data points at (0,1) and (0,2).  
   What type of modulation does the modem use?    [2] 
 (c) (i)  Four stations have the following bi-level chip sequences (Walsh 
codes): 
   A = (-1 +1 -1 -1 -1 -1 +1 -1) B = (-1 +1 -1 +1 +1 +1 -1 -1) 
   C = (-1 -1 +1 -1 +1 +1 +1 -1) D = (+1 +1 -1 +1 -1 -1 -1 +1) 
   A CDMA receiver obtains the following bi-level chip sequence: 
   S = (-1 +1  -3 +1 -1  -3  +1 +1). Which of the four stations transmitted, 
and which bits did each one send? [4] 
  (ii) Most 3G mobile phone systems use a form of Wideband Code 
Division Multiple Access (WCDMA). It is impossible for all phones to 
be synchronised such that the chip sequences transmitted are exactly 
orthogonal. How is this problem overcome in practice?  [3]
