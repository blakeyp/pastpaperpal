3. (a) Explain, using appropriate pseudo-code, how the bounded waiting property of 
the critical section problem can be guaranteed.    [5] 
(b) Using a two-process system, develop an example to illustrate the nature of the 
problem that arises if the test and set primitive to ensure mutual exclusion is 
not executed atomically.       [5] 
(c) Explain when a page fault occurs in a virtual memory system and how such a 
fault is handled.        [5] 
(d) You are given the following reference string for referenced page numbers: 
7, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 7, 4, 0, 1, 5, 4, 0, 3 
Assume that a process can have up to 4 pages in memory at any time and that 
memory is initially empty. By clearly showing your working, calculate the hit 
ratio when the following page replacement policies are used: 
(i) First In First Out (FIFO).       [5] 
(ii) Least Recently Used (LRU).      [5]
