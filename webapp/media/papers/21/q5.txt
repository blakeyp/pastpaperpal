5. (a) (i) Describe the operation of the Go-Back-N sliding window data link  
   protocol. Do not give details of all the possible error scenarios. [7] 
  (ii) What advantage and what disadvantage does the Go-Back-N protocol 
have over a simple Stop-and-Wait protocol? [2] 
  (iii) The following data fragment occurs in a data stream to which a  
   (data-link) byte-stuffing algorithm is to be applied: 
     A  B  ESC  C  ESC  FLAG  FLAG  D. 
   What is the output after stuffing?     [2] 
(b) (i) List the essential function(s) of the Internet Protocol (IP) and state the 
ISO OSI level at which it operates.     [3] 
(ii) In IP, the checksum covers only the header and not the data. Why do 
you suppose this design was chosen?     [3] 
(iii) A network on the Internet has a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0. What is 
the maximum number of hosts it can handle?   [2] 
(c) (i) List the essential function(s) of the Transmission Control Protocol 
(TCP) and state the ISO OSI level at which it operates.  [3] 
(ii) A client sends a 125-byte request to a server located 100 km away over 
a 1 Gbps optical fibre. The speed of signal propagation in the optical 
fibre is 2 x 108 m/s. What is the efficiency of the line during the remote 
procedure call?       [3]
