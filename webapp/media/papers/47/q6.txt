6. (a) What is meant by orthographic and perspective projection? What is the
screen y coordinate of (px, py, pz) if the centre of projection is at (0, 0, 0)
and the view-plane is at a distance d from the viewer? [6]
(b) A viewing system is defined with the eye at (0, 0, 1), an up-vector (0,−1, 0)T
and a view plane given by  
x
( 0 0 −1 ) y  = 0.

i. What are the view coordinates (vx, vy) of world coordinates (wx, wy, wz)?
[4]
ii. What are the screen coordinates of the same points on a viewport of
size H ×W which is centred on the view axis and has an up-vector
which is at φ degrees to the vertical axis? [4]
ø
(0, 0)
W
(c) Describe carefully the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm.
Illustrate your answer with the following example. Show when it can fail
to work correctly.
