2. (a) Write down the parametric equation of a line between points (x0, y0) and
(x1, y1). [4]
(b) What inequalities need to be satisfied for this line to be clipped against a
box with opposite corners at (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax)? [4]
(c) Using your answer to (b), explain the Liang-Barsky Clipping method for
a line which crosses one or more clipping boundaries. [11]
(d) In what ways is the Liang-Barsky method more efficient than the Sutherland-
Cohen method? [6]
