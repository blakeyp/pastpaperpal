1. (a) Distinguish between real-time and off-line computer graphics. How does
computer graphics exploit human visual capabilities to achieve visual re-
alism? [4]
(b) What are the principal elements of a graphics system and what are the
roles of an application model and a graphics kernel? [4]
(c) What is meant by rasterization? Explain why standard frame-buffers store
colour, transparency and depth information. [7]
(d) i. Specify the 3D rotation matrix that rotates points about the z-axis
by θ degrees.
ii. Specify the rotation matrix that takes the negative z-axis onto the
positive z-axis.
iii. Give the set of rotations required to rotate a point about an arbitrary
axis (a, b, c)T which passes through the origin.
iv. What further homogeneous transformations would be required if the
arbitrary axis in (iii) passed through a point (e, f, g) instead of the
origin?
Give a set of OpenGL transformation statements which implements a
rotation of θ degrees, about axis (a, b, c)T which passes through point
(e, f, g).
