4. A piece-wise polynomial, Bezier approximation curve of order n = 2 needs to
be designed to fit a set of points {pk}.
(a) What set of blending functions need to be specified and, hence, what is
the parametric form of the curve Q(u)? [4]
(b) Using your previous answer, or otherwise, derive a matrix form of Q(u).
[6]
′
(c) Write down the first derivative of the curve, Q (u), and state the boundary
condition which will ensure C1 continuity for successive piecewise approx-
imations. [4]
(d) Given ∆Q(u) = Q(u + δ) − Q(u) and ∆2Q(u) = ∆Q(u + δ) − ∆Q(u),
what are the constant terms,
{∆2Q(0),∆Q(0), Q(0)}
needed to accelerate the drawing of Q(u)? [8]
(e) How many multiplies and adds would be needed to trace part of a quadratic
Bezier patch over one u+ δu or v + δ step? [3]
