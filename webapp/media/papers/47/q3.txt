3. (a) Distinguish between diffuse and specular reflectors. What is meant by
global illumination? State briefly how it can be approximated. [6]
(b) Describe and illustrate the Phong lighting model for a single point light
source. Explain carefully the purpose of the parameters of the model. [6]
(c) With appropriate diagrams and equations, explain how interpolated shad-
ing is achieved. What is meant by per-pixel shading and why is it expen-
sive to calculate? Give and expression for the per-pixel shading value at
the origin, (0, 0), for a triangle:
{(−1,−1), (1,−1), (0, 1)},
if the vertices have the illumination and normal attributes,
{I0,n0}, {I1,n1}, {I2,n2}.
[6]
(d) Explain how texture mapping works in terms of the necessary coordinate
transformations required. [7]
