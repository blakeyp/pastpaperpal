2. (a) Consider the following grammar, assuming S is the start symbol:
S â†’ A #
A â†’ A z | B y
B â†’ A x | x y | 
Calculate the First and Follow sets (where applicable) for S, A, and B. Show
the steps taken to reach your solution. [10]
(b) Draw the Characteristic LR Automaton for this grammar and write, for each
state, the closure of items matched at that state. [10]
(c) Explain the need to calculate Nullable sets when calculating First sets. [5]
