6. (a) Instruction Selection algorithms try to reduce the running ‘cost’ of generated
code. Explain the factors that affect the calculation of the cost of machine
instructions. [5]
(b) Explain the role of the architecture of the target machine (ie whether a RISC or
CISC processor) in the design of the Instruction Selection phase of a compiler.
[6]
(c) In the context of data-flow analysis, explain what is meant by a reaching defini-
tion, and justify whether this information flows backwards or forwards through
a control flow graph. [7]
(d) Explain what is meant by a live variable and justify whether this information
flows backwards or forwards through a control flow graph. [7]
