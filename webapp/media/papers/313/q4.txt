4. (a) Summarise what is meant by three-address code and discuss the difference be-
tween triple and quad notations. [5]
(b) Consider the following code fragment:
a = 45 * a + 2 * (a + b);
Translate it into three-address code and explain informally the translation pro-
cess. [6]
(c) Explain and illustrate the translation of multidimensional arrays, in particular:
i. The processing of the declaration of an array, such as in Java or C. [7]
ii. The translation of an access to an array element into some intermediate
