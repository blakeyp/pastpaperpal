1. (a) Describe the main phases of traditional compilers, and summarise the kinds of
errors in input programs that must be dealt with in each phase. [6]
(b) Consider the following grammar:
Rexpr → Rterm ′+′ Rterm | Rterm ′−′ Rterm
Rterm → Rterm Rfact | Rfact
Rfact → Rfact ′∗′ | Rprim
Rprim → ′a′ | ′b′
i. Explain why this grammar is or is not suitable for top-down parsing. [6]
ii. Left-factor this grammar. [6]
iii. Eliminate left-recursion from the resulting grammar. [7]
