1. (a) Explain, using examples, how forward and backward chaining control reasoning in
rule-based systems. [3]
(b) i. What is meant by conflict resolution in the context of rule-based systems? [2]
ii. Describe how and why refractoriness and specificity are useful techniques for
conflict resolution. [3]
(c) Suppose you are deciding what train to catch, and could use your mobile phone to
download the current timetable. You are unsure whether you charged your phone,
but there is a 40% probability that it is charged. If the phone is charged there is a
70% probability of successfully downloading the timetable. You assign a successful
outcome a utility of +50 and an unsuccessful outcome a utility of âˆ’50. If the phone
is not charged the probability of success is 0.1%.
i. Create a decision tree for this problem. [4]
ii. Solve the decision tree to determine whether you should try to download the
timetable. [6]
(d) Define the terms causal link and clobbering in the context of partial order plans, and
state how to avoid a clobbering conflict. [3]
(e) Describe the operation of conditional planning in the context of POP. [4]
