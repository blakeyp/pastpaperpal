Answer FIVE questions in total. These must be Question 1, any TWO ques-
tions from Section A, and any TWO questions from Section B.
Read carefully the instructions on the answer book and make sure that the par-
ticulars required are entered on each answer booklet.
Calculators are not allowed.
The following Haskell functions are set as exercises in this exam either by provid-
ing definitions for you to use or having you prepare your own: foldl, last, length,
product, reverse, and sum . Thus the implementations of these functions as available
in the Standard Prelude must NOT be used in this exam.
