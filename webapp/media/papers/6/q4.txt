4. Define each of the following functions in Haskell using a first order function
definition and an iterative approach.
(a) match :: [Char] -> Bool is a function to parse simple expressions of the
following form. Each expression may contain the characters ’(’, ’)’, and
a lower case letter in the range ’a’ to ’z’. For an expression e to be
correct, that is, for match e to evaluate to True , the brackets must
match up in the usual way. For example, match "" , match "(x)" , and
match "(x(y))" each evaluates to True . And, match ")(" , match "(()"
, and match "(+)" each evaluates to False . [10]
(b) final :: [a] -> a is a function which for the empty list [] returns a
suitable error message, and for a non-empty list returns the final item. For
example, final "CS256" evaluates to ’6’ , and final [1,3,6] evaluates
to 6. [10]
