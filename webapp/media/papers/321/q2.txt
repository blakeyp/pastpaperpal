2. (a) Describe PCA and give its mathematical relation to an eigenvalue decomposition
problem. When is it useful to apply PCA and how would you choose the number of
principal components to use? [7]
(b) What is overfitting and how can we prevent overfitting in decision tree models? [6]
(c) Give the mathematical description of 3 different distance metrics. What distance is
suitable for binary-valued vectors? [6]
(d) Starting from first principles derive the likelihood function for linear regression as-
suming white noise. Describe the maximisation problem associated with both a Max-
imum Likelihood and a Maximum-a-Posteriori approach for this setting. [6]
