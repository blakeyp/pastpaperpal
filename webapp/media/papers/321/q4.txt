1. (a) The probabilistic output of a binary classifier on a test set of 10 observations is de-
picted in the left column of Table 1 together with the true labels in the right column.
Calculate the Precision and Recall for a decision threshold of 0.5. Show your work-
ing. [9]
(b) What is the range of values the decision threshold can take in order for the classifier
to get 0 False Positives on this test set? [7]
(c) Calculate the point on the ROC curve for the probabilistic classifier using its output
in Table 1 and a decision threshold of 0.6. What is the AUC and what information it
conveys? [9]
P (t∗ = +1) True Class
0.4 -1
0.4 +1
0.6 +1
0.2 -1
0.6 -1
0.1 -1
0.6 +1
0.4 +1
0.5 +1
0.5 -1
