3. (a) Explain the concept of Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV). When would
you use LOOCV? [4]
(b) Describe Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) and provide a mathematical and intuitive
description of Stress. Explain the difference between Metric and Non-Metric MDS.
[6]
(c) Give the mathematical description of the Manhattan distance between two vectors xi
and xj . What is the relation of the L1 norm to the Manhattan distance? [4]
(d) For a specific probabilistic model the probability for an unseen observation x∗ ∈ RD
to belong to class k is given by:
∗ | p(x
∗|t∗ = k,X, t)P (t∗ = k)
P (t = k X, t,x∗) = ∑K
j=1 p(x
∗|t∗ = j,X, t)P (t∗ = j)
i) Is this a generative or a discriminative model? Why? [2]
ii) Re-write the likelihood of this model under the Naive Bayes assumption. [2]
iii) What should P (t∗ = 1) be equal to if we have a binary classification problem and
90% of the training observations belong to class 0? [2]
(e) In the context of Bayesian Line∫ar Regression (BLR) the predictive density of interest
is given by p(t∗|x∗,X, t) = p(t∗|x∗,w)p(w|X, t)dw. Apply Bayes rule in the
posterior density and describe each resulting term within the context of BLR. What
probability density function we typically use for i) the likelihood, and ii) the prior?
What type of pdf is the resulting posterior density? [5]
