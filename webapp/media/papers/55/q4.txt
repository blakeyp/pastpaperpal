4. (a) When writing a program in Java, the programmer chooses to design the software by 
using a particular Abstract Data Type. When coding the program, the programmer 
discovers that a class exists within the Java Collection Framework (JCF) which 
appears to implement that ADT. 
State three reasons why the programmer may choose to use the JCF class rather than 
implement the ADT directly.       [3 marks] 
(b) What are the differences between an interface and an abstract class in Java? 
          [4 marks] 
(c) How would a programmer use a Java interface in order to assist them coding an 
ADT?          [6 marks]
