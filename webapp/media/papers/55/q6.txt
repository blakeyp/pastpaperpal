6. (a) Describe the adjacency list and adjacency matrix structures for representing 
unweighted directed graphs.        [8 marks] 
(b) Give one example of an application for which an adjacency list representation would 
be appropriate, and one for which an adjacency matrix would be suitable. Justify 
your answers.          [4 marks] 
(c) Describe using pseudo-code the depth-first and breadth-first search methods which 
can be applied to graphs.       [10 marks] 
(d) Using the following graph state the order in which the nodes will be traversed for 
depth-first search (starting at “a”).      [1 mark]

(e) Using the same graph as (d) state the order in which the nodes will be traversed for 
breadth-first search (starting at “a”).      [1 mark]
