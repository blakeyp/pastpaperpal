5. (a) Describe the main steps in the register allocation algorithm, including both coalescing
and spilling. [8]
(b) Compare and contrast the use of Maximal Munch with the use of Dynamic Program-
ming for instruction selection. How does the target architecture affect the choice of
instruction selection method? [8]
(c) Explain the process of efficiently translating Boolean expressions into jump instruc-
tions to true and false branches. Illustrate the method using the following code frag-
ment:
if x < y and z = a + b then x := y else x := -y ;
y := x ;
