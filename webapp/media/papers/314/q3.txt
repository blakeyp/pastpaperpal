3. (a) Explain the role of item grammars in building bottom-up parsers and the role of the
look-ahead input token in resolving conflicts. [8]
(b) Construct an LR(0) state machine for the following grammar, where S is the start
symbol:
S → A $ | x b $ A→ a A b | B B → x
[8]
(c) Consider the following grammar:
(1)E → E ; D (4)T → int
(2)E → D (5)T → real
(3)D → T L (6)L→ L , id
(7)L→ id
Extend the grammar with attribute rules, associating each identifier with an attribute
to represent its type and placing this information in a simple symbol table. Assume
that there is an external function that associates each identifier with an attribute s
such that id.s contains the string value of id.
