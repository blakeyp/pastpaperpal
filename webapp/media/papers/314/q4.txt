4. (a) Explain the usefulness of virtual machines as targets of compilation instead of creat-
ing object code directly. [8]
(b) Describe activation stacks, and explain how they support the use of non-local names
for languages with static binding. [8]
(c) Describe the sequence of instructions that need to be performed when calling and re-
turning from functions. In your explanation consider the following function, assum-
ing that the values of the non-local integer variables x and y should not be modified
and that the language uses dynamic binding:
f (x, y)
{ int z;
z := 3 ;
x := x * 3 ;
y := g(x) + y ;
return (x * y) }
