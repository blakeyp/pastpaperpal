2. (a) Explain the difference between top-down and bottom-up parsing. Explain the mean-
ing of the abbreviations LL and LR which are often used to denote the two ap-
proaches. [8]
(b) Consider the following grammar, where S is the start symbol:
S â†’ A $ Aâ†’ B A a |  B â†’ b B c | A A
Calculate Nullable, First, and Follow for A and B. [9]
(c) The First and Follow sets are used primarily to predict grammar rules in a top-down
parser, but they can also be used for syntax error recovery. Show how syntax errors
can be managed, using First and Follow sets for a grammar for arithmetic expressions
as an example. [8]
