3. (a) The formulas of difference logic are built from Boolean operators and predicates of
the form x − y ≤ c where x and y are some integer variables and c is an integer
constant.
Describe how to translate the following job-shop scheduling problem to the satisfia-
bility problem for difference logic:
We are given a finite set of n jobs, each of which consists of a chain of
operations. There is a finite set of m machines, each of which can handle at
most one operation at a time. Each operation needs to be performed during
an uninterrupted period of given length on a given machine.
We need to decide whether there exists a schedule, i.e. an allocation of the
operations to time intervals on the machines, whose total length is smaller
than or equal to a given constant. [15]
(b) How can the satisfiability problem for difference logic be solved efficiently? [20]
