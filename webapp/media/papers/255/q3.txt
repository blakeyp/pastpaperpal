3. (a) Explain the motivations for the simplification of logical expressions. [4]
(b) Karnaugh maps and Boolean algebra can both be used to simplify logical expressions,
such as the ones shown below.
F = Ā.B̄.C̄ + Ā.B̄.C + Ā.B.C̄ + A.B.C̄ + A.B.C
i. Simplify F using Karnaugh maps or Boolean algebra. [9]
ii. Design a logic circuit that implements F . [8]
(c) Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of using a Karnaugh map to simplify
a logical expression instead of Boolean algebra. [4]
