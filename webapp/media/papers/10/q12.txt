12. Alice creates an RSA public key pair. She chooses 17 and 11 as the two prime 
numbers to generate the public key and 7 as the other publicly-known value e. 
 i. How is the public key generated?           [4] 
 ii. Explain the principle used to generate the publicly-known value e    [2] 
iii. What is the formula to generate the private key?       [6] 
 iv. Alice wants to send the letter “M” (the numeric representation of M is 88) to 
Bob. What is the formula that Alice should use to generate the cipher message?  [4] 
 v. What is the formula that Bob should use to decrypt the cipher message?  [4]
