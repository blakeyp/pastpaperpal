5. (a) Consider the state space shown below, in which the arcs represent the legal successors
of a node. Arcs are bi-directional and are labelled with the cost of performing the
corresponding action. The start state is A and the goal is F. Suppose that you are
given a heuristic, h1, defined by the following table.
Node A B C D E F G H
h1 12 7 4 12 4 0 1 6
3
B E 4
F
6 7 2
7 9 G
A C
5
8 8 H
8
D
For each of the following search methods, show the resulting search tree, list the
sequence in which nodes are removed from the queue, and state how many nodes are
expanded. You should also state the route found and its associated cost. Assume that
nodes are inserted into the queue in alphabetical order. When expanding a node, do
not generate its parent.
i. Uniform cost search [5]
ii. Greedy best-first search [4]
iii. A* search [5]
(b) Now suppose you are given another heuristic, h2, defined by the following table.
Node A B C D E F G H
h2 12 7 4 12 7 0 5 8
i. Use A* to determine a route from A to F using h2 as the heuristic, showing your
search tree and giving the sequence of nodes expanded. State the route found
and its associated cost. [3]
ii. For the above problem, which is the better heuristic, h1 or h2, and why? [2]
(c) Briefly outline alternative procedures for how you might determine heuristics for a
problem, and how you might combine multiple heuristics into a single useful heuris-
tic. [6]
