1. Primitive Data Types
(a) Describe what is meant by variable declaration and assignment with ref-
erence to Java’s primitive data types. Give valid examples of variable
declaration and valid examples of variable assignment. [4]
(b) Provide answers to the questions given below.
i. Is String one of Java’s eight primitive data types? If it is not, state
why this is the case.
ii. Is it possible to convert a numeric value to another numeric type?
What are the benefits of doing so, and should the programmer be
aware of any potential pitfalls?
iii. When a variable is declared, what initial value does it contain?
[6]
(c) i. Write a short program that, given an 8-bit binary number (stored
in an array), converts this number to an unsigned, positive, base-10
integer value. Given the input 00001111 your code should return 15;
given the input 10101010 your code should return the value 170.
ii. Modify your code so that it also outputs the unsigned, positive, base-
10 integer value represented by flipping the bits. In the case of the
input 00001111, as well as outputting 15, your code should also out-
put 240 (i.e. the value of 11110000).
iii. Describe how you would modify your code so that the most significant
bit (in the input) was to act as a sign bit; that is, the left-most bit
determines whether the number is positive (when it is 0) or negative
(when it is 1).
