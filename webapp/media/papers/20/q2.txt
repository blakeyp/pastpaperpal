2. (a) Explain the difference between combinatorial logic and sequential logic. [3]
(b) A 1-bit full-adder performs addition on two significant bits and a previous carry bit.
i. Draw the truth table for a 1-bit full-adder. [4]
ii. Design a logic circuit that implements the truth table of a 1-bit full-adder. [5]
(c) D-type flip-flops are used in the design of many common sequential logic circuits.
i. Draw and explain the truth table for a D-type flip-flop. [3]
ii. Design an N-bit register using D-type flip-flops. Your design should be capable
of storing N bits in response to a single clock cycle. State any assumptions. [5]
iii. Design an N-bit binary counter using D-type flip-flops. Your design should give
an explanation of how the circuit operates. State any assumptions. [5]
