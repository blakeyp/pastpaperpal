3. (a) Bresenham’s line algorithm uses the decision parameter P (k) for the kth
step of the method:
P (k) = 2∆y x(k)− 2∆x y(k) +K.
If the line goes between the end points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):
i. Step-by-step, derive and expression for P (k+1), and the constant K.
[5]
ii. What two values can P (k+ 1) take and what does that mean for the
algorithm? [3]
iii. What is the initial value of P (k), and which values can be pre-
calculated knowing only the endpoints of the line? [3]
iv. What conditions need to be imposed on the slope? How can arbitrary
slopes be dealt with without sacrificing efficiency? [4]
(b) How could antialiasing be incorporated into Bresenham’s line algorithm?
[5]
(c) What are the winding-number values at locations A, B, C, D, E, and F
for the following two polygons? (Vertices are numbered in the order they
are drawn).
