5. (a) How can a Z-buffer be used to correctly deal with hidden surfaces? What
instructions are required to use depth buffering in OpenGL? [3]
(b) How can multiple transparent and opaque surfaces be properly blended
using Z-buffers and alpha blending? [5]
(c) What is back-face culling and how is it implemented? [4]
(d) How can ground-plane shadows be generated of a polygon mesh consisting
of 3D points Pi, for a distant light source at world coordinate L, assuming
that the ground plane is at z = 0? [6]
(e) What are shadow volumes and how can they be used together with stencil
buffers to produce realtime shadows? [7]
