4. A 3D object, O, can be viewed from a position p by looking in direction v.
(a) Sketch the viewing geometry giving all parameters required to map the
object on to a view plane. [5]
(b) If a viewport on the view plane has size W ×H, what 3D and 2D trans-
formations are required to project vertices of O ensuring that those inside
the viewport are in the range [0, 1]? [6]
(c) How can the edges of the object be efficiently clipped to the viewport
using the Sutherland-Cohen method? Illustrate your answer with three
typical cases. [7]
(d) Write down the set of inequalities for the line (x1, y1)→ (x2, y2) which are
necessary to set up the Liang-Barsky clipping algorithm on a normalised
viewport. State the parameter values for intersections of the line with the
four edges of the viewport. [7]
