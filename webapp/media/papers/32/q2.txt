2. (a) Giving examples, distinguish between diffuse and specular reflection. [4]
(b) Describe and illustrate the Phong lighting model for a single point light
source. Explain carefully the purpose of the parameters of the model. [7]
(c) Calculate an expression for the Phong shading value at the origin, of a
triangle with vertices:
(-2, -2, 0) (4, -2, 0) (0, 2, 0),
if the vertices have corresponding illumination and normal values:
I1,n1 I2,n2 I3,n3.
[7]
(d) Explain how texture mapping works, giving the necessary coordinate
transformations required. [5]
(e) An image needs to be mapped to a rectangle of size width by height
in OpenGL. Give the missing statements in the following code fragment
which specifies source and target coordinates:
glBegin(GL_QUADS);
// missing statement 1
glVertex2i (0, 0);
// missing statement 2
glVertex2i(width , 0);
// missing statement 3
glVertex2i(width , height);
// missing statement 4
glVertex2i (0, height);
glEnd ();
