3. Object Oriented Programming
(a) It is said that the “four pillars” of object oriented programming are: Abstraction,
Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Explain the meaning of two of these
concepts with relation to OO programming in Java. [4]
(b) Fractional values in Java are usually stored using the IEEE-754 floating point stan-
dard. Inherent in the standard is a possible loss of precision; this can be avoided for
common fractions by storing the value as a numerator and a denominator separately.
i. Design a class, Fraction, that stores a common fraction as an integer numera-
tor and an integer denominator. You should provide three constructors (a default
constructor, an n constructor and an n constructor). [3]
1 m
ii. Write appropriate accessor and mutator methods for your class. [2]
iii. Write appropriate methods for adding and subtracting two Fraction objects.
[3]
iv. Write appropriate methods for multiplication and division of two Fraction
objects. [3]
v. Write a method, reduce, that returns the Fraction in its most reduced form. [5]
