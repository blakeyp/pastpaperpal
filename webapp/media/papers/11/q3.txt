3. (a) Explain the four types of reasoning that can be done using probabilistic inference. [4]
(b) Suppose a doctor sees a patient with a high temperature. The doctor knows that dis-
ease A causes a rash in 80% of cases. The doctor also knows the prior probability of
disease A is 1/50,000, and the prior probability of a patient having a high temperature
is 1/100. What is the probability that the patient has disease A? [3]
(c) Suppose that there are two tests, that use independent methods, for determining
whether shale gas is present at a site. Test A is 97% effective at identifying shale
gas when it is present, but has a 15% false positive rate. Test B is 90% effective at
identifying shale gas and has a 5% false positive rate. You have a set of possible
sites, each of which has a 1 in 100 chance of having shale gas. Suppose that you only
have time to use one of the tests. Which test returning positive is more indicative of
the presence of shale gas? Justify your answer mathematically, giving the relevant
probabilities. [6]
(d) Using the Bayesian network given below compute the probability of NoFuel given
that ChargeLight and FuelLight are true. You should use inference by enumeration
and show your working. [12]
