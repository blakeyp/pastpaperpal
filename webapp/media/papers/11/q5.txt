5. (a) Using the Venn diagram decision procedure, determine if the following are valid or
invalid syllogisms:
All hawks are birds
Some birds are brown [2]
∴ Some hawks are not brown
All hawks are birds
Some birds are brown [2]
∴ Some hawks are brown
All cars are vehicles
No house is a car [2]
∴ No house is a vehicle
(b) In the context of rule-based systems, describe the processes of forward and backward
chaining. Use examples to illustrate how these processes work. [3]
(c) Anna’s cricket team, Coventry, is going to play her friend Bill’s team, Durham. Bill
offers Anna a friendly bet: whoever’s team loses will buy the dinner next time they
meet up. They never spend more than £30 on dinner. Had there been no bet, they
would share the cost of dinner equally. When deciding whether to accept this bet,
Anna will have to assess her team’s chances of winning (which will vary according
to the weather on the day). She estimates the probability of her team winning when
the Weather is wet to be 0.75 and the probability of her team winning if the weather
is dry to be 0.2. The prior probability of it raining is 0.2.
i. Create a decision tree for the problem. [4]
ii. Solve the decision tree. [5]
iii. Represent the problem using an influence diagram. [3]
iv. Extend the influence diagram to show how you would incorporate the availability
of a weather forecast. What additional information will be required to solve the
new influence diagram? [4]
