6. (a) Define the terms causal link and clobbering in the context of partial order plans. [4]
(b) Show how a partial-order regression planner works by deriving a plan for the Blocks
World problem described below. The available operators are as follows.
Action(PutOnTable(b),
P recond : On(b, x) ∧ Clear(b),
Effect : On(b, Table) ∧ Clear(x) ∧ ¬On(b, x))
Action(PutOn(b, x),
P recond : On(b, z) ∧ Clear(b) ∧ Clear(x),
Effect : ¬On(b, z) ∧ ¬Clear(x) ∧ Clear(z) ∧On(b, x))
The initial state for the problem is
On(C,A) ∧On(A, Table) ∧On(B, Table) ∧ Clear(B) ∧ Clear(C)
and the goal state that your plan must achieve is
On(A,B) ∧On(B,C) ∧On(C, Table) ∧ Clear(A). [5]
(c) Describe what is meant by conditional planning, and why it is useful. [4]
(d) Suppose you have been asked to design a system for the control of a heating system.
i. Describe how you would use a genetic algorithm to identify the best set of pa-
rameters for the system, including in your answer an explanation of crossover
and mutation. [6]
ii. Describe how you could use hill-climbing instead of a genetic algorithm, and
explain how you would try to prevent your algorithm getting stuck in a local
optima. [4]
iii. Would there be any advantage to using A* to find the best set of parameters?
Explain your reasoning. [2]
