- Tidy/refinement/testing of marks_extractor together with questions_extractor
- Extend questions_extractor to optionally reset find_q when new section found
- Also, what about when question finishes on something other than text e.g. image?
- Extend to capture (a few) common edge cases
- Maybe write some scripts to do some testing?
- Work out how marks info is going to be used at front-end
    - e.g. to recommend time to spend on a question/part
    - to emphasise number of marks allocated to a question/part
    - also how is this info best stored?
